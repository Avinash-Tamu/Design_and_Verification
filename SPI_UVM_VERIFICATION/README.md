# UVM Verification for HTAX and SPI

This repository contains UVM-based verification environments for two IP blocks:
- **HTAX (High Throughput) Interface**
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**

The verification environment is built using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) for verifying both HTAX and SPI interfaces.
