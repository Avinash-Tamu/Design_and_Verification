# UVM Verification for HTAX, YAPP and SPI

This repository contains UVM-based verification environments for multiple IP blocks:
- **HTAX (High Throughput) Interface**
- **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**
- **YAPP ROUTER (Yet Another Packet)**

The verification environment is built using UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) for verifying HTAX, SPI and Router Design interfaces.
For Yapp, only the YAPP interface was added, but the design contains Router Design, HBUS, CLOCK, andCHANNELS components.
